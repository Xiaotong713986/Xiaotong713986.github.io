                        Thirty-third Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS2019), 2019.
                        <p>In this paper, we propose one novel model for point cloud semantic segmentation, which exploits both the local and global structures within the point cloud based on the contextual point representations. Specifically, we enrich each point representation by performing one novel gated fusion on the point itself and its contextual points. Afterwards, based on the enriched representation, we propose one novel graph pointnet module, relying on the graph attention block to dynamically compose and update each point representation within the local point cloud structure. Finally, we resort to the spatial-wise and channel-wise attention strategies to exploit the point cloud global structure and thereby yield the resulting semantic label for each point. Extensive results on the public point cloud databases, namely the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. </p>

                        IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR2019), 2019.
                        <p>In this paper, we devise a saliency prediction model for stereoscopic videos that learns to explore saliency inspired by the component-based interactions including spatial, temporal, as well as depth cues. The model first takes advantage of specific structure of 3D residual network (3D-ResNet) to model the saliency driven by spatio-temporal coherence from consecutive frames. Subsequently, the saliency inferred by implicit-depth is automatically derived based on the displacement correlation between left and right views by leveraging a deep convolutional network (ConvNet). Finally, a component-wise refinement network is devised to produce final saliency maps over time by aggregating saliency distributions obtained from multiple components. In order to further facilitate research towards stereoscopic video saliency, we create a new dataset including 175 stereoscopic video sequences with diverse content, as well as their dense eye fixation annotations. Extensive experiments support that our proposed model can achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods on all publicly available eye fixation datasets.</p>
