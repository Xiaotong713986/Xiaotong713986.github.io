# Introduction of the reasearch group
Our research group is mainly committed to <u>intelligent analysis and coding of 3D scenes.</u>  The research group emphasizes that students should be taught according to their talents, and the training program should be formulated in combination with students' knowledge background and research direction.  Three postgraduate students have been admitted to the Department of Computer Science of city University of Hong Kong with full scholarships.  Our research group is developing rapidly. <u>We sincerely welcome potential candidates to join us.</u>  

Research interests in Enrollment and Recruitment:
- 3D scene analysis and understanding: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, 3D visual significance analysis, etc  
- 3D scene perception and coding: image/video coding compression, 3D point cloud data compression, adaptive content distribution and transmission optimization, etc  
- AI + defect visual detection: Cooperated with a listed company of a science and innovation board to carry out surface defect detection and pre-research in the field of integrated circuits
