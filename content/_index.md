# Introduction of the reasearch group
Our research group is mainly committed to <u>intelligent analysis and coding of 3D scenes.</u>  The research group emphasizes that students should be taught according to their talents, and the training program should be formulated in combination with students' knowledge background and research direction.  Five postgraduate students have been admitted to the Department of Computer Science of city University of Hong Kong with full scholarships.  Our research group is developing rapidly. <u>We sincerely welcome potential candidates to join us.</u>  

At present, the research topics of the project group are mainly carried out around the following three research tasks: 
- Intelligent processing and immersive 3D video data compression: this task is fund by NSFC funds/shenzhen key project of basic research. We studies immersive media 3D video data representation and computation, efficient coding compression, viewpoint synthesis, visual perception and quality evaluation and other common key technologies, which is involved in the application of VR, AR and digital.    
- 3D scene perception and understanding: This task cooperates with senior experts and researchers of The Visual Intelligence Department of Meituan, and currently focuses on the semantic segmentation algorithm of 3D point cloud.    
- Video and image big data system: This task, in cooperation with Shenzhen Customs and Guangming Laboratory, studies intelligent solutions and systems of big data around the scientific problem of small probability and high risk event discovery and prediction.
